The Top 5 Things Landlords Wish Tenants Knew

- Pay your bills on time. Seems fairly obvious, I know, but many tenants believe they can pay every other bill before they pay the rent. Want to stay on our good side? Please pay your rent on time.
- Always try to be polite. I will, too. Being polite and calm really does go a long way. You would not like it if I left you snarky or angry screaming messages on your voicemail. I know sometimes issues can seem to linger on and on, but we really are doing our best to get things resolved.
- Listen to our instructions. We tell you things for a reason. If we show you how to trip a breaker or turn a gas valve off, listen. It may just save your butt. If we tell you there will be a hard freeze tonight and to please let your faucet drip, don’t call us the next day and complain that your pipes have frozen and you need to do laundry. I can’t control the weather, so you will just have to wait until it warms up.
- Help us. We try to take care of our properties, but we can’t be everywhere all the time. Is there something we need to know about? Tell us. Is something broken? Let us know. Help us by being our eyes and ears.
- Tell the truth. Did you or your kid flush something down the toilet and stop it up? Then tell us the truth so we can get the problem resolved as quickly as possible. After a dozen years in this business, we can almost always determine the culprit anyway.

Am I Eligible For Housing Assistance & How Do I Apply?

Eligibility is dependent on the program which you are applying for. Typically PHAs have housing programs specifically for low-income families, veterans, the disabled and elderly. Low-Income ranges are published yearly by HUD and are dependent on family size and location.


PHAs require an application be submitted to determine eligibility. In most cases, applications are added to a waiting list due to the high demand for low-income housing in many communities.


Things To Think About Before Renting

The best thing to do before you begin searching for your first apartment is budget for upfront costs, long-term costs and all the things you’ll need to buy.


Secure a move-in day before you sign the lease to book a moving van, movers and plan our packing.


Start turning your apartment into a home by making a wish list of furniture, conceptualizing the decor and thinking about where you’ll put everything


How Long Is The Wait For Housing Assistance?

Due to the high demand for housing assistance, waiting lists are generally very long and could take years for an application to come to the top of the list. Each PHA may give an estimated wait time and/or actual placement on the list at their own discretion, and will vary depending on any waiting list preferences that a housing agency may have.


While you are waiting to reach the top of a waiting list, you can search for other open waiting lists on www.gosection8.com and sign up to receive alerts when a waiting list opens. We list open waiting lists on a wide range of affordable housing from Section 8 Vouchers and Public Housing to tax-credit housing and other affordable housing options. You may also search our nationwide database of open below-market rental units available now.


Should You Invest In Renters Insurance?

Long story short, is Yes! A basic renters insurance plan covers 3 different types of risk, which are likely to occur during your regular life. The three basic renters insurance plans cover:

- Personal property plans cover the cost of replacing or repairing your possessions if they get damaged, destroyed, or stolen. For example, if a water pipe were to burst in your bathroom and flood over into your kitchen, ruining your new laptop, personal property coverage will pay to replace the laptop.
- Liability plans include the cost of fixing someone else's property if you damage it, or paying for someone else's medical bills if they get injured in your home. For example, if your child throws a ball through the window, smashing the glass, liability insurance will pay to fix the window.
- Living expenses means that if something happens to make your home uninhabitable, your insurance company will pay for you to stay somewhere else. For example, a fire breaks out in your apartment, and you can't live there until the smoke damage has been treated. Your living expenses insurance plan will pay the cost for you to stay in a hotel until you can return to your apartment.

What's the Difference Between a Tenant and a Subtenant?

A tenant has signed a lease or rental agreement with a landlord. A subtenant, on the other hand, is someone who subleases or rents all or part of the rental property from a tenant, and does not sign a lease or rental agreement with the landlord.

Savvy landlords want all occupants of a rental unit to sign a lease or rental agreement and typically prohibit subtenants without the landlord’s written consent. This gives the landlord some control over who lives in the rental unit and a legal relationship with all residents (crucial when it comes time to collecting rent or ending a tenancy)

In a few states, including California and Florida, landlords may not unreasonably withhold their consent to a subtenancy, unless they have a good business reason for doing so (for example, if a subtenant does not meet the landlord’s criteria for selecting tenants, in terms of credit history, references, and the like).
